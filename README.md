<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

iWish is a web app made to manage wishlists. I created it out
                  of the need to categorize the wihslists I usually have on a
                  googlesheets spreadsheet and have a central page to manage
                  
  Even though it was made for wishlists, I often also see myself
  using for other purposes like groceries lists, to-dos, and
 checklists.
